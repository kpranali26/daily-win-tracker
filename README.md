 🧠 Daily Win Tracker

A simple, clean, and motivating habit tracker web app that helps users log their daily wins across three areas: **Physical 💪, Mental 🧠, and Spiritual 🧘‍♀️**. 

Built with **React**, **Firebase**, and deployed using **Vercel**, this project encourages daily consistency and visual streak tracking for self-growth.

 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **User Authentication** (Sign up / Log in securely with Firebase)
- ✅ **Task Checklist** for physical, mental, and spiritual goals
- 📊 **Circular Progress Bars** to visualize daily completion
- 📅 **Streak Calendar** showing daily consistency
- 💾 **LocalStorage Support** to save data (with option to scale back to Firestore)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Frontend  | Backend / DB | Deployment |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| React.js  | Firebase (Firestore + Auth) | Vercel |
| CSS       | LocalStorage (fallback)     |        |

🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. Users sign up and log in using Firebase Authentication.
2. They create or view existing daily tasks in three categories.
3. Each day, users check off completed tasks and submit them.
4. Their progress is visualized through animated circular progress bars.
5. A streak calendar reflects how consistent they've been!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
